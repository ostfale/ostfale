## Hi there 👋 I'm Uwe Sauerbrei

✨ Seasoned Senior Developer and backend enthusiast.

My expertise lies in the JVM ecosystem, specifically designing and implementing efficient microservices with Kotlin and Java. I utilize the full potential of Quarkus for minimal memory footprint and fast startup times, alongside the versatility of Spring Boot. <br><br>
I have been leading the Java User Group Hamburg for more than a decade, organizing close to 300 events on various topics within the Java and general IT ecosystem.
